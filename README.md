# CloudWatch agent best practices

CloudWatch is an essential monitoring service offered on AWS Console to track the events and health of various resources. In order to monitor the health of compute resources like EC2 OR OnPrem instances, the CloudWatch agent would need to be installed and configured. The latest [CloudWatch agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html) offers unified functionality of exporting both the logs and metrics from the compute resources to the CloudWatch service.

It is a recommended best practice to install CloudWatch Agent on the compute resources spawned for various Operating Systems in order to export logs and desired metrics to CloudWatch service.

This document will guide the user through the series of steps to install CloudWatch agent on EC2 and OnPrem compute instances running Windows OR Linux Operating System and review the exported logs and metrics on CloudWatch.
Though there are multiple methods to installCloudWatch agent (using SSM / manually via command line / using AWS CloudFormation), we will follow the installation using SSM.

## Pre-Requisites

A running EC2 instance:
It is recommended to install AWS Systems Manager agent on the desired compute instances and associate an IAM role with **AmazonEC2RoleforSSM** policy.Once configured, please ensure the instances are visible under the Systems Manager Registered Instances. For more information on procedure to install AWS Systems Manager agent, please follow this link: [About AWS Systems Manager Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/prereqs-ssm-agent.html)

**Note:** Ensure the SSM Agent is running and with version 2.2.93.0 or later.

Example of EC2 running Amazon Linux2 AMI:

Linux Command(s):
```console
sudo systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent
rpm -qa amazon-ssm-agent
```
